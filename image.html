        <p> Chandru! Being a full-stack developer means you have expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, allowing you to work on various aspects of a software application.<br> On the frontend, you're likely familiar with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.<br> On the backend, you might work with server-side languages such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, or Java, along with frameworks like Express, Django, or Ruby on Rails.

            <br>Your role involves building user interfaces, handling server-side logic, working with databases, and ensuring the seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components.<br> Full-stack developers are valuable assets in the software development process, as they can contribute to all stages of a project.
